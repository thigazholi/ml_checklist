<summary>1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture </summary>

1. Define the objective.
2. How will your solution be used?
3. What are the current solutions/workarounds?
4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/ unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
5. How should performance be measured?
6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experiance or tools?
9. Is human expertise available?
10. How would you solve the problem manually?
11. List the assumptions you or others have made so far?
12. Verify assumptions if possible.

<summary>2. Get the data </summary>

Automate as much as possible
1. List the data you need and how much you need.
2. Find and document where you can get that data.
3. Check how much space it will take.
4. Check legal obligations, and get the authorization if necessary.
5. Get access authorizations. 
6. Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
7. Get the data. 
8. Convert the date to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).
9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g. anonymized)
10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.)
11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).
